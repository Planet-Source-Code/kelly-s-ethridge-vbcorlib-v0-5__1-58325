## VBCorLib v0\.5


</div>

### Description

This is a milestone release of VBCorLib. VBCorLib is a VB6 implementation of the .NET mscorlib assembly, providing many of the classes that are available to .NET developers to now be available to VB6 developers. This release includes much of the System.IO namespace which primarly consists of Streams and File/Directory manipulation, and a few fixes. In conjunction with this release is a new website dedicated to VBCorLib (www.kellyethridge.com/vbcorlib). The site is in constant updating as I'm trying to get some tutorials online. This archive also includes the unit-tests and will require SimplyVBUnit v1.4.x to run. You not have to run the tests.
